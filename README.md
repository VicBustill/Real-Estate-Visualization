Customer (Daira Guadalupe Aguilar) - The Customer drives the project, setting goals and priorities, explains stories, and views CRC sessions.

Coach (Jessie Flores) - The Coach schedules meetings, makes sure the meeting process is followed, records results of meetings for future reporting, and passes them to the tracker.

Developer (Jessica Lynn Barrios) - The Developer estimates stories, defines engineering tasks from stories, estimates how long stories and tasks will take, and implements stories and unit tests.

Tracker (Santiago Garcia) - The Tracker goes around and asks each Programmer how he’s doing, listens to the answer, and takes action if things seem to be going off track. Actions include suggesting a CRC session, setting up a meeting with the customer, asking the coach or another programmer to help

Tester (Victor Gonzalez-Bustillo) - implements and runs functional tests. Graph the results, make sure people know when test results decline
