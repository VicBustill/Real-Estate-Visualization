# Real-Estate-Visualization
A software tool whose main objective is to make data comprehension more readable for both home buyers and Real Estate employees.

**<ins>   Problem statement:   </ins>**
Buyers cannot compare neighborhoods as quickly, information of listings can vary from sites. Due to them being scattered around in spreadsheets or sites, using data visualization can help. 
During meetings, agents are unable to rapidly display pricing trends/information by neighborhood.
Software should adapt to most recent computed data.
Buyers should be able to see computed data that is full and accurate with no crashes.
